                Please have patience when using ShieldVPN. Proxy IPs each have their own speeds and uptime percentages, and there is a very likely chance that the region you tried to use simply was unable to connect at that given moment. You could try again later and it could connect instantly.

                Just because you CAN connect, does not mean you will be able to instantly do what you want on the web from your given proxy IP. The ones provided for you on the public list were specifically tested for use on <a href="https://4chan.org/"><b>https://4chan.org/</b></a>, and are only included after they have managed to fully upload a post and bypass the captcha systems. You can either use these to post straight-on, or go through a free proxy IP list until you are able to find one that works for your intentions.

                Trial and error. You are provided the list of test proxies for a reason, the developers of ShieldVPN want to make the experience easier and more user friendly. It could take a while, sometimes even hours: but you will always be able to find a usable proxy IP.
